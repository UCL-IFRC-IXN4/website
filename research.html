      <div class="text-col col-lg-6">
        <p>Our project aims to be the backbone of an online resource very similar to IFRC GO.
           Our project requirements only include the backend (obtaining, merging, and analysing the data)
            and no front end (displaying the data on a website).
        </p> 
        <p>
        The main features of the IFRC GO platform, which we are trying to mimic, is their ability
         to coherently present important real time data from around the world in a clear and concise manner.
        </p>

    <h2 class="subheading">Database Structure</h2>
    <div class="row">
      <div class=" col-lg-3">
      </div>
      <div class="text-col col-lg-6">
        <p>There were multiple solutions to approaches to analysing
           and processing the raw data to obtain more useful information.
            The first thing we had to decide as a team was what distribution
             was going to represent our data. We were going to go with a normal
              distribution approach at first, but after consulting a team of UN data
               scientists, we were advised to use a different implemention as disasters are typically not normally distributed.
                 After doing some research, we opted to use bootstrapping to get the
                  data shaped as close as possible to a normal distribution. We considered other types of distributions,
                    such as a zero-inflated negative binomial distribution model,
                     but we were unable to due to time constraints.</p>
        <p>We have several potential data structures for storing our merged data. Possible data structures include
           linked lists, hash tables, and trees. A linked list would provide for convenient addition and removal of
            elements and can be easily implemented. However, accessing information in a linked list can be time
             consuming as nodes can only be accessed sequentially. A hash table would be efficient for information access
              due to a constant time complexity. However, hash tables have a chance of creating duplicate
               keys, especially as we deal with large amounts of data. Our final data structure to take into consideration
                is a tree. A tree would be able to showcase the relationship between the different information we have.
                 The downside is that iterating through a tree would be more complex to implement compared to linked lists and hash tables.</p>
        <p>To represent the final set of data in a table format, it made most sense to implement a 2D array.</p>

        <p>Our approach is to use python as it is the most intuitive for both the 
          data scraping and cleaning. It was also the 
          programming language our group was the most familiar with, having 
          experienced using it in past projects.</p>

        <p>Pandas were used for easy and efficient dataframe manipulation. 
          Because we need to download and merge different sources of data, os/sys is also employed to navigate between directories.</p>
        <p>For data scraping, the requests library is used to open html files and to identify download links. Selenium is also employed to navigate through multiple webpages. 
           Pycountries is an important library involved in data cleaning; it helps translate country names into their respective ISO-3 codes.</p>
        <p>The abc (abstract class) library is also used to avoid code duplication and ensure subclass consistency. </p>

      <div class="text-col col-lg-6">
        <p>All in all, the approach we took was to use python as our main programming language,
          representing the raw data in a in a normal distribution (shaped via bootstrapping) and implementing
          said libraries in our code. We will represent the merged raw data in a unique tree structure, as time
          complexity was of little concern, and the final dataset with the processed data would be situated in a
          2D array.</p>
